#Description of Website
In the midst of all the work and extracurricular activities, it may be hard for a student to keep track of all of his/her responsibilities. We wish to design a platform where students can schedule their time and and crowdsource their assignments/deadlines with ease. On the website, students will have a fully customizable, crowdsourced planner. Students can view the tasks/events for “Today” ordered by priority assigned by the user. Students can also view what’s going to occur/be due later in the week. Additionally, students can view their tasks/tasks on a monthly calendar. Their tasks/events can be added personally, but if you join classes/clubs/private groups, the tasks/events posted by other students in those groups will be also part of your planner. Lastly, we will have a “profile page” for each student where they can edit their information, such as name, email, and groups joined, and also view their credibility score. The credibility score will increase/decrease depending on the number of upvotes/downvotes on a person’s posted tasks and the number of tasks a person posts.
